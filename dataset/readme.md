# Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Augmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and augmenting data to prepare it for machine learning workflows. The notebook includes step-by-step processes to handle real-world datasets effectively, addressing issues like missing values, outliers, data scaling, and transformations. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are applied to enrich the dataset and improve model generalization.

## Objectives
- Perform thorough data cleaning by handling missing and inconsistent values.
- Apply preprocessing techniques, such as normalization and feature encoding.
- Implement data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of machine learning models.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values:** Identified and handled missing data using techniques like mean imputation and forward-fill.
- **Outlier Detection:** Detected and treated outliers using statistical methods (e.g., z-score analysis).
- **Duplicate Removal:** Checked for and removed duplicate records.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Scaling:** Applied normalization and standardization to ensure uniform feature distribution.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converted categorical data to numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.
- **Data Splitting:** Divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### 3. Data Augmentation
- Applied transformations like rotations, scaling, flipping, and noise addition to augment image data.
- Used oversampling techniques, such as SMOTE, for imbalanced datasets.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python** for scripting and implementation.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing and augmentation utilities.

## Results
- Improved data quality by resolving inconsistencies and scaling features.
- Augmented datasets with new samples to enhance diversity and address class imbalance.
- Prepared clean, well-processed data for effective machine learning model training.
